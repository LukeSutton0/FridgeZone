**Setup and Installation**

TODO: create up to date docker image.

Download source code from github

Download Node.js

Open Terminal 1: 

1) cd to client folder
   
2) npm install
   
3) npm start
   
Open Terminal 2:

1) cd to server folder
   
2) npm install
   
3) npm install -g nodemon
   
4) nodemon server.js

**Usage and Details**

Once you have the webapp working, create a Head Chef account and sign in. 

New accounts must be verified by the Head Chef so I would reccommend keeping this tab open.

The Head Chef can perform most of the available tasks such as:

• Adding and Removing stock

• Managing Users

• and more...

**ChangeLog & Roadmap**

Final release has been completed.

Project Improvements TO DO:

• Create docker image for download simplicity.
